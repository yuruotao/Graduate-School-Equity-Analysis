# Graduate School Equity Analysis

<h2>Introduction

This repository is created to measure the equity of a university, especially in the student recruiting sector. When I was choosing school for graduate study, I always hear the rumor of a school being unjust in the retesting stage, especially to those who do not have a well education background. I acknowledge the significance of the retest section, but undeniably, discrimination exist. Thus, based on the past data, I applied correlation analysis among the scores on the initial test, scores on the retest, and the final outcome (1 for accepted, 0 for fail) to quantify the equity. The usage of code is depicted below.
